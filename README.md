1. There are five operations the user can choose from: additition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. User chooses which operation by inputting an integer from 1 to 5.
2. If user chooses addition, it will take three input numbers, add it, and give an output.

3. If user chooses subtraction, it will take three input numbers, subtract it, and give an output. It will subtract the numbers in the following order: first - second - third. 

4. If user chooses multiplication, it will take three input numbers, multiply it, and give an output.

5. If user chooses division, it will take three input numbers, divide it, and give an output. It will divide the numbers in the following order: first/second/third. 

6. If user chooses exponentiation, it will take two input numbers, exponentiate it, and give an output. It will exponentiate the numbers in the following order: first^second. 

7. If user inputs an invalid option or non number, an error message is given.
